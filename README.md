## Colors of Fenway
### A psychogeographical map of sorts.

An art project for `ARTF 2223: 5D Fundamentals: Experience and Drawing`, prompted by Guy Debord's [Theory of the Dérive](http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/theory.html). The project [site](https://ctlnwng.github.io/colors-of-fenway/) features four illustrations of Boston's Fenway area and a color palette associated with each illustration. Read the [artist's statement](https://ctlnwng.github.io/colors-of-fenway/statement.html) for more details.
