                <p><b>Colors of Fenway</b> is a collection of drawings that uses color to create a
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychogeography">psychogeographical</a>
                    “map” of Boston’s Fenway area. Each drawing is a low-poly vector version of a photo, and 
                    each photo is of a distinct section of Fenway. These sections include The Fens park, a 
                    residential area, Fenway Stadium, and a commercial district.</p>

                <p> My goal with this piece is for my audience to get a sense of what each part of Fenway 
                    feels like through something as simple as color. Translating photos into a collage 
                    of 2D organic shapes abstracts away from individual details that are irrelevant to 
                    understanding the essence of each location. 
                </p>
                <p>Alongside each drawing is a color palette created from the main colors in the drawing. I urge my 
                    audience to recognize that the color palettes are not curated nor planned, but rather directly 
                    extracted from the natural or man-made surroundings I encountered. We often do not pay attention 
                    to how well the colors of our environment work together. <b>Colors of Fenway</b>  intends to address 
                    that and encourage an appreciation for the colors that characterize our everyday surroundings.
